# Bank Note Authenticity Analysis

# Overview
This project aims to determine the authenticity of banknotes using machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains features extracted from images of genuine and forged banknotes.


Class (Target): Authenticity label (0 for genuine, 1 for forged).
# Algorithms Used
Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Neural Network - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)


# Data Preprocessing: 
Perform data cleaning, normalization, and feature scaling as necessary.

Model Training: Train each algorithm using the preprocessed data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Comparison: Compare the performance of different algorithms to identify the most effective one for this task.


# Conclusion
Based on the evaluation results, the Neural Network (MLP) algorithm achieved the highest accuracy and overall performance. It is recommended to use the MLP model for banknote authenticity analysis.
